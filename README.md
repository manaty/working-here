# Working-here
All resources needed for those working at manaty

## Modo

Tell what you do, do what you say.

## tools we use
* skype : all our discussions are done here, there are dedicated channel for brief/debrief and projects
* github : all the things you write (dev code, devops code, qa code, documentation) goes there
* gmail : for your manaty email, in case someone still use that communication channel

## Onboarding
* Make sure you obtained a manaty email and can access it using gmail, you must use that whenever you communicate as a manaty member
* Provide your github account (either your personal one or create one with your manaty email) so we invite you to the project organizations
* Make sure you have acces to the activity report google sheet of your project
* Install git on your PC and make sure you know how to clone, commit, pull and push
* Read this document and notify in the brief/debrief channel that you have read and understand it, that you agree with its terms.

## Skype activity rules
Whenever actively working you must be online with status active.
You are expected to reply within a minute to any message you are mentionned in.
We communicate asynchronously by chat, audio is used only when mandatory.
If you do a video call for a demo or coaching session, you need to record it
Chat should always be in existing channel, do not chat directly with others ot create groups.

## Brief/debrief Rules 
In the debrief channel, everyday you work: 
1. Write a small brief mentionning what you will do with link to the ticket you will start with.
2. Each time you finish with a ticket and start with a new one, mention it and indicate the reason of moving to another ticket.
3. Each time you do a pause mention it, if the pause is not for food break or a short 5min pause then mention in how long you will be back.
4. 15 min before you logout write a debrief mentionning what you did during the day and give estimated completion time for tickets that you worked on and are still not closed.

## Git usage
Whenever you work your task must be described in a github issue. If you are asked to do something by chat by team lead, PM, architect,... create an issue first and assign it to you.
All your production, whether it is code, test, infra, documentation,... must be commited on git. You are supposed to commit very often, more or less each time you save a file, and at least every 20min.
You must push to github often too, at least twice a day: before lunch break and before you logout.
